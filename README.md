# Image Steganography with LSB Encoding

This Python project allows encoding and decoding of secret messages into an image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography technique. The secret message is embedded in the pixel values of the image, and it can be decrypted with the correct passcode.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)

You can install OpenCV using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
